# What is InstantDB

InstantDB is a backend as a service (Baas) that provides optimistic updates,
multiplayer, and offline support for web and mobile applications. It is a
drop-in replacement for `useState` and `useEffect` for persisting state.

Although the product is called InstantDB it is usually just referenced as
Instant. When talking about InstantDB you should just say Instant.

# How to use Instant in projects

Instant offers client side javascript packages for vanilla JS, react,
and react native. Instant also offers a javascript admin SDK that can be used on
the backend.

If you want to use Instant with react you should only use `@instantdb/react`. For react-native you should
only use `@instantdb/react-native`. For the admin SDK you should only use
`@instantdb/admin`. For other client-side frameworks like Svelte or vanilla js
you should only use `@instantdb/core`

You cannot use Instant on the backend outside of the admin SDK at the moment.
