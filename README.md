# Instant LLM Guides

Guides for helping LLMs to develop with Instant.

**Updated**:

We've condensed the guides into a smaller set of rules to make it easier for LLMS to follow

**Previous**

* Individual guides are located in `guides/`
* Guides are combined into `combined/rules.md` via `make combine` 

In the future we could expand this into an evals system for LLMs to test their
ability to follow the guides.
